# Notes App

This project is developed in React along with Material UI for styling. Currently, this app version does not support authentication.

## How do you use this app to make it your own?
- Download the code and change the **Layout.js** file to include your name as it currently has mine. 
- To include more categories for your notes, make changes to Create.js and simply add more Form Labels in the RadioGroup.

###### That's all you need to know to make this app your own!! 

- [ ] I will be adding authentication to this app so that a user can simply login into the app via his Google Account. ** Stay Tuned **
